    "question": "What is the primary purpose of a load balancer?",
    "answer": "A load balancer distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers to prevent any single server from becoming a bottleneck. It improves availability (traffic reroutes if a server fails) and enables horizontal scaling by adding more servers behind the balancer."

    "scenario": "Your web application experiences a sudden 10x traffic spike during a flash sale. The database is becoming the bottleneck. What steps do you take?",
    "response": "Immediate: enable read replicas to offload read queries, add a caching layer (Redis/Memcached) for hot data. Short-term: implement connection pooling to reduce DB connection overhead, add rate limiting to protect the database. Longer-term: evaluate sharding strategy for write scaling, consider CQRS to separate read and write paths."

    "card_type": "tradeoff",
    "option_a": "Vertical scaling (scale up)",
    "option_b": "Horizontal scaling (scale out)",
    "comparison": "Vertical scaling is simpler — upgrade CPU/RAM on one machine. But there's a hardware ceiling and it's a single point of failure. Horizontal scaling distributes data across multiple machines, offering near-unlimited growth, but adds complexity: sharding logic, cross-shard queries, and data consistency challenges."
